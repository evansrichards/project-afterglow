# Project Afterglow ‚Äî MVP Technical Implementation Overview

## Guiding Principles
- **Privacy-first:** Client-side PII sanitization with user review before optional cloud sync for enhanced insights and persistence.
- **Lightweight stack:** Favor proven libraries and hosted services with generous free tiers to shorten build time while keeping maintenance low.
- **Explainable insights:** Every surfaced pattern should link to clear evidence and suggestions so users feel supported, not surveilled.
- **Modular data pipeline:** Treat Tinder and Hinge exports as interchangeable inputs that normalize into one schema for downstream analysis.

## System Architecture Snapshot (One-Time Analysis MVP)
1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite):** Handles file upload, parsing, PII sanitization, and processing status display. Shows basic stats immediately, then guides to wait for analysis completion. Deployed on a static host (e.g., Netlify or Vercel).
2. **Cloud Storage (Supabase + Postgres):** Stores sanitized data with email-linked accounts for one-time analysis processing.
3. **AI Analysis Pipeline:** Processes uploaded data once using tiered analysis system, generates comprehensive insights.
4. **Email Notification System:** Sends summary notification when analysis is complete with link to authenticated report.
5. **Report Dashboard:** Secure, authenticated view of full analysis results accessible only to the user.
6. **Design System:** Tailwind CSS with a custom theme that echoes the brand's calm, affirming tone.

## Data Ingestion & Normalization
- **Supported Inputs:**
  - Tinder "Data Download" JSON bundle (notably `messages.json`, `user.json`).
  - Hinge "Request My Data" ZIP, focusing on CSV/JSON conversation exports.
- **Upload Flow:** Drag-and-drop zone validates file type/size, explains privacy, and provides sample data.
- **Parsing Strategy:**
  - Use `jszip` to unzip archives client-side.
  - Employ schema-specific parsers (pure functions) for each platform, converting raw fields into a shared interface: `Match`, `Message`, `Participant`, `Metadata`.
  - Normalize timestamps to ISO strings and convert time zones using `date-fns-tz`.
  - Deduplicate users by platform IDs and stitch multi-file relationships (e.g., matches ‚Üî messages) before storing in IndexedDB.
- **Data Validation:** Run lightweight checks (required columns, message counts) and surface friendly errors when exports are incomplete.
- **Observed Export Structures:**
  - **Hinge CSVs** (`examples/hinge/messages_sample.csv`, `examples/hinge/matches_sample.csv`) feature columns for `conversation_id`, sender role, prompt metadata, delivery status, and match origins.
  - **Tinder bundle** (`examples/tinder/messages_sample.json`) nests messages inside a match list with `_id`, `person`, and reaction arrays while storing timestamps in ISO-like strings.
  - Capture first-run schema snapshots (column order, inferred types) in local storage so regressions can be surfaced when new files deviate.
- **Adaptive Schema Detection:**
  - Inspect column headers/JSON keys and build a dynamic `FieldMap` that pairs canonical fields with source variants (`sent_at`, `sent_date`, `timestamp`, etc.).
  - Persist unknown fields as `CustomAttribute` metadata so insights can evolve without dropping context.
  - Version each parser adapter and log schema diffs to the console + telemetry (if enabled) to guide future updates.

## Unified Data Model
Any columns or JSON keys the adapters do not recognize map into `attributes` (match-level) or `raw.data` objects so analysts can
experiment without waiting for a deploy while the UI still renders core insights.
```typescript
type Platform = 'tinder' | 'hinge';

type CustomAttributeValue = string | number | boolean | null | string[] | number[];

interface RawRecord {
  platform: Platform;
  entity: 'match' | 'message' | 'profile';
  source: string;                       // filename or JSON path
  observedAt: string;                   // timestamp capture
  data: Record<string, unknown>;        // untouched payload for audit trail
}

interface ParticipantProfile {
  id: string;
  platform: Platform;
  name?: string;
  age?: number;
  genderLabel?: string;
  location?: string;
  prompts?: Array<{ title: string; response: string }>;
  traits?: string[];                    // derived (e.g., job titles, schools)
  isUser: boolean;
  raw?: RawRecord;                      // optional pointer to source
}

interface MatchContext {
  id: string;
  platform: Platform;
  createdAt: string;
  closedAt?: string;
  origin?: string;                      // like, rose, boost, super-like
  status: 'active' | 'closed' | 'unmatched' | 'expired';
  participants: string[];
  attributes: Record<string, CustomAttributeValue>;
  raw?: RawRecord;
}

interface NormalizedMessage {
  id: string;
  matchId: string;
  senderId: string;
  sentAt: string;
  body: string;
  direction: 'user' | 'match';
  delivery?: 'sent' | 'delivered' | 'read' | 'unknown';
  promptContext?: { title?: string; response?: string };
  reactions?: Array<{ emoji: string; actorId: string; sentAt: string }>;
  attachments?: Array<{ type: 'image' | 'video' | 'voice' | 'link'; url?: string }>;
  raw?: RawRecord;
}

interface SchemaFieldMapping {
  canonical: keyof NormalizedMessage | keyof MatchContext | keyof ParticipantProfile | string;
  aliases: string[];                    // observed variants
  transform?: (value: unknown) => unknown;
}

interface ParserAdapter {
  platform: Platform;
  version: string;
  detect: (fileMeta: { name: string; headers: string[] }) => boolean;
  fieldMappings: SchemaFieldMapping[];
  normalize: (records: RawRecord[]) => {
    participants: ParticipantProfile[];
    matches: MatchContext[];
    messages: NormalizedMessage[];
  };
}
```
- Store normalized data in IndexedDB via `idb` library for snappy offline queries.
- Generate derived metrics (response times, word counts, conversation length) using memoized selectors to avoid recomputation.

## Two-Stage AI Analysis Pipeline (Cost-Optimized MVP)

### Architecture Overview
Instead of a complex multi-component pipeline (3 analyzers + 4 evaluators = 7 API calls), we use a streamlined two-stage approach that reduces costs by 50-80% while maintaining quality:

   - **Outputs:**
     - Safety risk level (green/yellow/orange/red)
     - Basic communication patterns
     - Attachment style indicators
     - Escalation decision (proceed to Stage 2 or complete)
   - **Result:** Green/yellow cases receive actionable insights and complete here

2. **Stage 2: Comprehensive Deep Analysis (20% Who Need It)**
   - **Model:** GPT-4 Turbo
   - **Cost:** ~$1.50-2.00 per escalated user
