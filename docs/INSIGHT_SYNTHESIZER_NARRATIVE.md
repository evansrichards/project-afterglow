# Insight Synthesizer - Creating Engaging Narrative

## Overview: The Master Storyteller

The Insight Synthesizer is the final processor that transforms all analysis outputs into a cohesive, engaging personal narrative. It takes clinical insights and crafts them into a story that feels like the best friend who truly "gets" you telling you about yourself.

## Core Responsibilities

### **1. Data Integration & Narrative Architecture**
```typescript
interface NarrativeArchitecture {
  dataIngestion: {
    // Receives outputs from all processors
    coreAnalyzerData: {
      dataIngestion: "Conversation metrics, timing patterns, platform data";
      safetyScreener: "Risk assessment, boundary examples, protective strengths";
      patternRecognizer: "Communication style, authenticity markers, behavioral patterns";
      chronologyMapper: "Growth trajectory, evolution patterns, time-weighted insights";
    };

    conditionalEvaluatorData: {
      riskEvaluator?: "Advanced safety analysis, educational content";
      attachmentEvaluator?: "Deep relationship patterns, attachment insights";
      growthEvaluator?: "Detailed evolution story, skill progression";
      crisisEvaluator?: "Safety resources, support integration";
    };
  };

  narrativeStructure: {
    universalArchitecture: [
      "Engaging opening hook with personal statistics",
      "Your Dating Superpowers (strength-first approach)",
      "Your Greatest Hits (specific conversation examples)",
      "Your Communication Personality (who you are in conversations)",
      "Your Growth Story (evolution and development)",
      "Your Next Chapter (future-focused insights)"
    ];

    enhancementIntegration: {
      growthEvaluator: "Replaces basic growth story with multi-chapter journey";
      attachmentEvaluator: "Adds relationship superpowers section";
      riskEvaluator: "Weaves safety education throughout";
      crisisEvaluator: "Prioritizes support resources";
    };
  };
}
```

### **2. Personality-Driven Content Selection**
```typescript
interface PersonalizedContentSelection {
  strengthIdentification: {
    // Identifies top 2-3 genuine superpowers from Pattern Recognizer
    algorithmicSelection: {
      questionAsking: "Frequency + depth + impact metrics";
      boundaryMaintenance: "Clarity + kindness + consistency scores";
      empathyValidation: "Response quality + emotional intelligence markers";
      authenticityExpression: "Genuineness scores + vulnerability comfort";
      conversationSustainability: "Engagement maintenance + topic navigation";
    };

    evidenceRequirement: {
      minimumExamples: 2; // Must have concrete conversation examples
      impactMetrics: true; // Quantified effect on conversations
      percentileRanking: true; // Must be genuinely above average
    };
  };

  conversationHighlightCuration: {
    // Selects most compelling examples from Pattern Recognizer analysis
    authenticityMoments: {
      criteria: "Highest authenticity score + positive outcome";
      format: "Context + exchange + impact";
      insight: "What this reveals about character";
    };

    boundaryExamples: {
      criteria: "Clearest preference expression + respected outcome";
      fallback: "If no clear boundaries, use preference communication";
      focus: "Kind but clear communication";
    };

    curiosityShowcase: {
      criteria: "Best example of their strongest communication pattern";
      adaptiveTitle: "Adjusts based on whether they're question-askers, validators, etc.";
    };
  };

  personalityArchetypeAssignment: {
    // Assigns communication archetype based on strongest patterns
    archetypeOptions: [
      "The Thoughtful Connector: High question frequency + emotional intelligence",
      "The Boundary Guardian: Clear limits + maintained kindness",
      "The Authentic Questioner: Deep curiosity + follow-up skills",
      "The Empathetic Listener: Validation + response quality",
      "The Genuine Storyteller: Authenticity + vulnerability comfort"
    ];

    customization: {
      signatureBehaviors: "Most frequent positive patterns";

      "Personal: Feels written specifically for them"
    ];
  };

  statisticPersonalization: {

    messageTimingData: {
      clinical: "Average response time: 3.7 hours";
      engaging: "âš¡ You typically reply within 4 hours (faster than 78% of people)";
    };

    authenticityPatterns: {
      clinical: "Authenticity scores 23% higher after 6 PM";
      engaging: "ðŸŒ™ You're 73% more genuine in evening conversations - night owl authenticity!";
    };

    curiosityMetrics: {
      clinical: "Question frequency 2.3x above average";
      engaging: "ðŸŽ¯ You ask 2.3x more questions than most people - curiosity is your superpower";
    };
  };

  narrativeConnectors: {
    // Creates smooth transitions between sections
    sectionTransitions: [
      "Your superpowers show up most clearly in your greatest conversation moments...",
      "These strengths have developed over time, and your growth story is remarkable...",
      "Looking at how you've evolved reveals something beautiful about who you're becoming..."
    ];

    insightWeaving: [
      "This pattern shows up in multiple ways throughout your conversations...",

## Technical Implementation

### **AI Prompt Engineering for Narrative Creation**
```typescript
interface NarrativePromptStrategy {
  systemPrompt: `You are an expert relationship therapist and dating coach who creates personalized,
                 engaging reports about people's dating communication patterns. Your goal is to help
                 people see themselves clearly while feeling celebrated and empowered.

                 Writing Style:
                 - Warm, encouraging friend who really knows them
                 - Specific examples from their actual conversations
                 - Strength-focused with growth opportunities framed positively
                 - Insightful pattern recognition they might not have noticed
                 - Personal and unique - feels written specifically for them`;

  dataPrompt: `Based on this user's conversation analysis data, create an engaging personal report
               that tells the story of who they are in dating relationships. Include specific
               examples, interesting statistics, and meaningful insights about their communication
               patterns and growth.`;

  structurePrompt: `Structure the report with these sections:
                   1. Opening hook with personal statistics
                   2. Dating superpowers (2-3 strengths with evidence)
                   3. Greatest hits (3 conversation examples)
                   4. Communication personality analysis
                   5. Growth story (evolution over time)
                   6. Future-focused encouragement`;
}
```

### **Conditional Content Integration Logic**
```typescript
interface ConditionalContentLogic {
  evaluatorIntegration: {
    growthEvaluator: {
      triggers: "Significant evolution detected";
      action: "Replace basic growth story with detailed multi-chapter narrative";
      enhancement: "Add skill progression tracking and future trajectory";
    };

    attachmentEvaluator: {
      triggers: "Complex attachment patterns identified";
      action: "Add relationship superpowers section";
      enhancement: "Deepen personality analysis with attachment insights";
    };

    riskEvaluator: {
      triggers: "Safety concerns detected";
      action: "Weave educational content throughout report";
      enhancement: "Reframe challenges as protective wisdom";
    };

    crisisEvaluator: {
      triggers: "High-risk situation identified";
      action: "Prioritize safety resources and immediate support";
      enhancement: "Professional resource integration";
    };
  };
}
```
