      "Increased vulnerability comfort",
      "Better awkward moment recovery"
    ];
  };
}
```

## Quality Assurance: Ensuring Universal Value

### **Minimum Content Standards**
```typescript
interface MinimumStandards {
  conversationExamples: {
    minimumRequired: 3; // One for each "Greatest Hits" category
    qualityThreshold: "Must show genuine skill or positive trait";
    fallbackStrategy: "If limited examples, focus on micro-moments of growth";
  };

  personalStats: {
    minimumMetrics: 8; // At least 8 interesting statistics
    diversityRequirement: "Mix of behavioral, temporal, and growth metrics";
    engagementStandard: "Each stat must reveal something meaningful about their personality";
  };

  superpowers: {
    minimumCount: 2; // At least 2 identified strengths
    evidenceRequirement: "Specific examples and impact metrics for each";
    percentileRequirement: "Must be genuinely above average in identified areas";
  };

  growthStory: {
    minimumSpan: "Must show some evolution, even over short periods";
    positiveFraming: "Focus on progress and development, not deficits";
    specificEvidence: "Concrete examples of improvement or skill development";
  };
}
```

### **Fallback Strategies for Limited Data**
```typescript
interface LimitedDataApproach {
  // For users with minimal conversation history
  fewConversations: {
    focus: "Quality over quantity analysis";
    approach: "Deep dive into available conversations";
    messaging: "'While we have limited data, here's what your conversations reveal...'";
  };

  // For users with low-engagement conversations
  surfaceLevel: {
    focus: "Potential and positive patterns";
    approach: "Highlight micro-moments of connection";
    messaging: "'Your conversations show someone who...' (focus on character traits)";
  };

  // For users with very recent data only
  shortTimespan: {
    focus: "Current strengths and style";
    approach: "Personality analysis over growth story";
    messaging: "'Here's your current dating communication style...'";
  };
}
```

This universal foundation ensures every user feels seen, celebrated, and understood through their personalized report, regardless of their conversation patterns or analysis complexity.
