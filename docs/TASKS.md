## ðŸŽ¯ DEMO FOCUS - Essential Tasks to Process First Dataset

**Goal:** Get the two-stage AI analysis pipeline working end-to-end with your first dataset.

**What's Working:**
- âœ… Data ingestion & normalization (Sections 1-4)
- âœ… Stage 1: Quick Triage (Safety Screener + Report Generator)
- âœ… OpenRouter integration
- âœ… All unit tests passing (32 tests total)

**What's Needed for Demo:**
1. **Task 5.3.1:** Build Stage 2 Comprehensive Analyzer (GPT-4 Turbo)
2. **Task 5.3.2:** Create Stage 2 Report Generator
3. **Task 5.4.1:** Build Basic Orchestrator (run Stage 1 â†’ Stage 2 if needed)
4. **Task 6.1.1:** Simple console output to view reports

**What's Deferred:**
- All UI/dashboard features (Section 6.2-6.4)
- Email notifications & authentication (Section 7)
- Privacy & security (Section 8)
- Data storage (Section 9)
- Cost monitoring & analytics (Section 10)
- Integration testing (Section 11.2-11.5)
- Launch preparation (Section 12)

## 3. Data Ingestion & Normalization

- [x] 3.1 Implement drag-and-drop upload zone with file type/size validation and sample data links.
- [x] 3.2 Integrate `jszip` pipeline to unzip Tinder JSON bundles and Hinge ZIP exports client-side.
- [x] 3.3 Build schema-specific parser adapters for Tinder and Hinge that output unified `Match`, `Message`, `Participant`, `Metadata` structures.
- [x] 3.4 Normalize timestamps to ISO strings with `date-fns-tz` and deduplicate participant identities across files.
- [x] 3.5 Persist raw schema snapshots and run validation checks (required columns, message counts) with friendly error messaging.
- [x] 3.6 Capture unknown fields into `CustomAttribute` metadata and log schema diffs with adapter versioning.

## 4. Simplified Data Model & Storage (MVP Scope)

- [x] 4.1 Implement TypeScript interfaces for normalized data (participants, matches, messages, raw records, field mappings).
- [x] 4.2 Create basic data persistence layer for sanitized entities in both IndexedDB (local) and Supabase (cloud).
