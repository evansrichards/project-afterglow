### 6.4 Implementation Notes

**Backend Options:**

1. **Option A: Express.js standalone server** âœ… CHOSEN
   - Pros: Simple, flexible, well-documented
   - Cons: Requires separate deployment
   - Setup: `npm install express cors dotenv`

2. **Option B: Next.js API routes**
   - Pros: Same deployment as frontend, serverless-ready
   - Cons: Need to migrate from Vite to Next.js
   - Setup: Convert to Next.js app

3. **Option C: Vite + Express hybrid**
   - Pros: Keep existing Vite setup, add Express API
   - Cons: More complex development setup
   - Setup: Add `server/` directory with Express app

**Current Data Flow:**

```
User uploads file â†’ Frontend parses data â†’
Send to POST /api/analyze â†’ Backend runs orchestrator â†’
Return complete results â†’ Display results
```

**Key Files Created:**

- âœ… `server/routes/analyze.ts` - Analysis endpoint
- âœ… `src/api/client.ts` - Frontend API client
- âœ… `src/components/results/AnalysisResultsDisplay.tsx` - Results display component

**Environment Variables:**

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... (backend only, required)
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 (backend CORS configuration)
```

  - âœ… Input: Normalized `{ messages, matches, participants, userId }`
  - âœ… Calculate volume metrics (match count, message count, active conversations)
  - âœ… Calculate time span metrics (first activity, last activity, peak period, days since last use)
  - âœ… Calculate activity distribution (matches/messages per month/year)
  - âœ… Generate human-readable summary (no AI needed - pure calculation)
  - âœ… Output: `MetadataAnalysisResult` interface
  - âœ… Unit tests: 8 tests passing
  - âœ… Demo script: `scripts/demo-metadata.ts`

- [x] 7.1.2 Add metadata analysis to backend API:
  - âœ… Updated `POST /api/analyze` endpoint in [server/routes/analyze.ts](../server/routes/analyze.ts)
  - âœ… Run metadata analyzer FIRST (before AI analysis) - completes in ~14ms
  - âœ… Return metadata in response with new `metadataAnalysis` field
  - âœ… Include metadata timing in response metadata
  - âœ… Updated API response types in [server/types/api.ts](../server/types/api.ts)

  - âœ… Shows real-time processing status with step-by-step progress
  - âœ… Auto-redirects back to /upload if no data provided
  - âœ… Runs analysis immediately on mount
  - âœ… Displays metadata preview as soon as available
  - âœ… Auto-redirects to /results when complete

- [x] 7.2.2 Build step-by-step progress display:
  - âœ… Step 1: "Uploading data..." (immediate)
  - âœ… Step 2: "Analyzing metadata..." (shows stats when available)
  - âœ… Step 3: "Running safety screening..." (Stage 1)
  - âœ… Step 4: "Performing comprehensive analysis..." (Stage 2)
  - âœ… Step 5: "Generating your report..." (final/complete)
  - âœ… Visual progress indicator with checkmarks and status icons
  - âœ… Color-coded steps (green=complete, blue=current, gray=pending)
  - âœ… Animated pulse effect on current step

- [x] 7.2.3 Display metadata preview:
  - âœ… Shows metadata results as soon as they arrive in purple card
  - âœ… Displays: Summary text (e.g., "You were active on tinder from Jan 2020 to Jul 2020")
  - âœ… Displays: Assessment text with context
  - âœ… Shows: Total matches, total messages in grid layout
  - âœ… Shows: Active conversations count
  - âœ… Shows: Days active on platform
  - âœ… All implemented in metadata preview section of ProcessingPage

- [x] 7.2.4 Add polling/streaming for real-time updates:
  - âœ… For MVP: Using simple state updates from single API call
  - âœ… Shows steps progressively with simulated timing for better UX
  - âœ… Metadata displays immediately when returned from API
  - Note: Full SSE/WebSocket streaming deferred (not needed for synchronous API)

- [x] 7.2.5 Auto-redirect to results page:
  - âœ… When analysis completes, automatically navigates to `/results` after 1.5s
  - âœ… Passes analysis results via React Router state
  - âœ… Shows "Analysis complete! Redirecting to results..." message before redirect
  - âœ… Passes both `result` and `platform` in state for ResultsPage

### 7.3 Results Page (NEW PAGE)

- [x] 7.3.1 Create ResultsPage component:
  - âœ… New file: [src/pages/ResultsPage.tsx](../src/pages/ResultsPage.tsx)
  - âœ… Route: `/results` configured in [src/App.tsx](../src/App.tsx)

  - âœ… Displays "Upload Your Data" button to navigate to /upload
  - âœ… Prevents errors with proper conditional rendering

### 7.4 Update Upload Page Flow

- [ ] 7.4.1 Update UploadPage navigation:
  - After file is parsed successfully
  - Change "Analyze Data" button to trigger navigation
  - Navigate to `/processing` with parsed data
  - Remove inline analysis results display

- [ ] 7.4.2 Move API call to ProcessingPage:

  - Useful for previewing data before committing to full analysis

- [ ] 7.5.2 Add progress streaming (optional):
  - Server-Sent Events endpoint: `GET /api/analyze/:jobId/stream`
  - Emit progress events as analysis stages complete
  - Frontend subscribes to stream and updates UI in real-time

### 7.6 Testing

- [ ] 7.6.1 Test metadata analyzer:
  - Unit tests for volume calculations
  - Unit tests for timeline calculations
  - Unit tests for activity distribution
  - Test with Tinder and Hinge sample data

- [ ] 7.6.2 Test multi-page flow:
  - Upload â†’ Processing â†’ Results navigation works
  - Data passed correctly between pages
  - Error handling at each stage
  - Back button behavior

**Implementation Priority:**

1. Start with 7.1 (Metadata Analyzer) - foundation for everything else
2. Then 7.2 (Processing Page) - shows metadata preview
3. Then 7.3 (Results Page) - displays final results
4. Then 7.4 (Update Upload Page) - connects the flow
5. Defer 7.5 (Backend Enhancements) - nice-to-have, not essential
