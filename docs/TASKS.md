### 6.4 Implementation Notes

**Backend Options:**

1. **Option A: Express.js standalone server** âœ… CHOSEN
   - Pros: Simple, flexible, well-documented
   - Cons: Requires separate deployment
   - Setup: `npm install express cors dotenv`

2. **Option B: Next.js API routes**
   - Pros: Same deployment as frontend, serverless-ready
   - Cons: Need to migrate from Vite to Next.js
   - Setup: Convert to Next.js app

3. **Option C: Vite + Express hybrid**
   - Pros: Keep existing Vite setup, add Express API
   - Cons: More complex development setup
   - Setup: Add `server/` directory with Express app

**Current Data Flow:**

```
User uploads file â†’ Frontend parses data â†’
Send to POST /api/analyze â†’ Backend runs orchestrator â†’
Return complete results â†’ Display results
```

**Key Files Created:**

- âœ… `server/routes/analyze.ts` - Analysis endpoint
- âœ… `src/api/client.ts` - Frontend API client
- âœ… `src/components/results/AnalysisResultsDisplay.tsx` - Results display component

**Environment Variables:**

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... (backend only, required)
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 (backend CORS configuration)
```
