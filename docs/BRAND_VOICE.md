# Project Afterglow Tone & Brand Guidelines

These guidelines translate the PRD's promise of a "warm, curious, validating" companion into concrete voice principles for the MVP. They cover overall personality anchors, voice pillars, microcopy guidance, and tonal calibrations for different UX moments.

## Voice North Star

Project Afterglow should sound like a thoughtful friend who notices patterns, celebrates growth, and honors vulnerability. Every line of copy should help users feel:

- **Reassured** that their data is safe and interpreted with care.
- **Seen** in their unique dating journey, without judgment.
- **Energized** to experiment gently and keep dating hopeful.

## Brand Pillars

Use these pillars to evaluate whether copy aligns with the experience we want to deliver.

1. **Compassionate Clarity** — Explain what’s happening in straightforward language while validating emotions (e.g., “Let’s take a moment to see what stood out in your conversations.”)
2. **Empowering Reflection** — Prompt self-trust and agency, offering invitations rather than prescriptions (e.g., “Want to jot down what felt energizing here?”)
3. **Curious Optimism** — Spotlight bright spots and possibilities without ignoring friction (e.g., “You’re sparking quick replies when you lead with curiosity.”)
4. **Privacy-Forward Transparency** — Plainly state how data is handled and give users control (e.g., “Processing stays on your device. You can clear everything anytime.”)

## Copy Principles

- **Warm, plain-language sentences.** Prefer conversational verbs and inclusive "we" or "let’s" phrasing when guiding actions.
- **Support before critique.** Lead with affirmations and strength framing before surfacing growth opportunities.
- **Gentle pacing.** Use short paragraphs and breathing room to mirror a calm, coach-like cadence.
- **Context-rich prompts.** When requesting input, remind users why it matters (“Capture what felt aligned so you can revisit it later.”)
- **Accessibility-aware.** Avoid idioms and gendered language; support screen readers with descriptive labels.

## Tone by Journey Moment

| Journey Stage | Emotional Context | Tone Guidance | Sample Language |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **Landing Page** | Users are curious but cautious about sharing data. | Lead with warmth, safety, and value proposition. | “Turn your dating exports into insights that cheer you on — all processed privately on your device.” |
| **Upload Flow** | Vulnerability is high; users are handling personal data. | Reassure, instruct clearly, normalize nerves. | “Take a breath — your messages stay with you. Drag in a ZIP or try our sample if you’d like a preview.” |
| **Processing State** | Anticipation; users want to know what comes next. | Keep them company, set expectations. | “We’re gently unpacking your conversations. Up next: a snapshot of what’s working and what to explore.” |
| **Insights Overview** | Users seek meaning and direction. | Celebrate strengths first, then introduce gentle nudges. | “Your curiosity shines. Let’s look at where conversations sparked momentum and where you might invite more balance.” |
| **Deep Dives** | Users are ready for specifics. | Offer reflective prompts, cite evidence, avoid blame. | “When replies slow, you often keep the energy flowing solo. Would pausing for a check-in feel supportive?” |
| **Reflection Workspace** | Users are introspective. | Provide space, affirm agency. | “Capture what you want to remember from this session. These notes stay with you.” |
| **Wrap-Up** | Transition moment; reinforce closure and next steps. | Encourage celebration and control. | “Nice work honoring your patterns today. Download your recap or clear your data whenever you’re ready.” |

## Microcopy & UI Patterns

- **Buttons & CTAs:** Actionable but soft (“Explore insights”, “Review this pattern”). Avoid pressure (“Fix this now”).
- **Tooltips & Helpers:** Offer encouragement + clarity (“Tip: Tags like ‘rose’ show up under Match Context so you can track what sparks momentum.”)
- **Error States:** Acknowledge feelings, provide next steps (“That file looks different than we expected. Let’s retry with the export’s original ZIP — we’ll keep everything local.”)
- **Empty States:** Invite exploration with positive framing (“Ready when you are. Upload a data bundle to see what already shines in your conversations.”)

## Review Checklist

Before shipping copy, ensure it:

- Reflects at least one brand pillar and doesn’t contradict another.
- Names the user’s emotional state or need when appropriate.
- Offers autonomy (choices, opt-outs) explicitly when dealing with data or next steps.
- Avoids judgmental adjectives about the user or their matches.
- Includes privacy reminders whenever data transfer/storage is mentioned.

## Collaboration Notes

- Pair writers with UX/design partners early so tone guides layout (space for breathing room, supportive visuals).
- Maintain a living example bank of approved phrases/snippets to reuse across the product.
- Revisit this document after initial usability testing to incorporate user language and feedback.
