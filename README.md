## Development Workflow

### Path Aliases

The project uses TypeScript path aliases for cleaner imports:

- `@/*` â†’ `src/*`
- `@components/*` â†’ `src/components/*`
- `@lib/*` â†’ `src/lib/*`
- `@hooks/*` â†’ `src/hooks/*`
- `@types/*` â†’ `src/types/*`
- `@pages/*` â†’ `src/pages/*`

Example:
```typescript
import Header from '@components/layout/Header'
import { parseMessages } from '@lib/parsers'
```

### Tailwind Theme

Custom theme aligned to brand voice with:
- **Afterglow colors** (warm sunrise palette)
- **Twilight colors** (calm secondary blues)
- **Insight colors** (semantic colors for different insight types)
- Custom typography scale optimized for readability
- Gentle animations for state transitions

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-First:** All file parsing and analysis happens in the browser
- **No Servers:** No data transmission to backend servers by default
- **Instant Delete:** Users can purge all data with one click
- **Optional Sync:** Encrypted cloud sync available only if explicitly opted-in

## Supported Platforms

Currently supports data exports from:
- Tinder (Data Download JSON bundle)
- Hinge (Request My Data ZIP)
